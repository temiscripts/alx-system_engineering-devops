## Development Guidelines

### Shell Script Standards

- **Shebang**: All scripts must start with `#!/bin/bash`
- **Line Count**: All executable scripts must be exactly 2 lines long
- **Permissions**: All scripts must be executable (`chmod +x`)
- **Newlines**: All files must end with a newline character
- **Forbidden**: Don't use `&&`, `||`, `;`, `bc`, `sed`, or `awk`

### Code Style

- Use meaningful variable names
- Follow POSIX shell scripting conventions where possible
- Comment your code when necessary
- Keep scripts simple and focused on one task

### Testing

- Test your scripts on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- Ensure scripts work with the expected input/output
- Run the provided test suite: `./test_all.sh`
- Verify line count: `wc -l script_name`

### Documentation

- Update README.md if you add new files
- Include usage examples for new scripts
- Document any environment variables required
- Update the file description table
